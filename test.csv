Double tap to zoom to 100% is very useful. I'll try to user it as default app - very promising. There are several issues that I've noticed from the start: 1. If I open some image - hide this app - go to home screen - and open this app again - it will start from it's albums view instead of displaying the same picture on which I left off. Very annoying. UPD.: Cannot reproduce it anymore. Strange:) 2. If I delete some picture - app will return to folder view but deleted picture thumbnail is still displaying. It goes away only after closing and opening this folder again. 3. Can't change sort direction (ascending - descending). I'm used to sort by name in descending direction - but app sorts only in ascending direction. There is a bit of a mess with timestamps - timezones - etc. - so names is quite useful for sorting. Also - I can't set different sort mode for different for different folders. 4. Current date or name is not showing while doing a quick scroll with scroll bar. It can make navigation much easier in folder with many photos. 5. Animation feels a bit slow (long duration). It's just my opinion.
