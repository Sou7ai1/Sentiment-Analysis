First of all let me thank you for the continued support of the Alarm Klock application. I've been happily using it for many years. However - I'm very unhappy about the new UI. Everything is more complicated now.  Consider changing the time of the alarm (which is something I do often): previously you clicked the alarm and you could start changing the time. Now you have to long-click the alarm - then click the time - an only then you can change it. Why make it more complicated? What's the purpose?  Other problems: - maximum volume-increase interval is now 60 seconds. In the old app I used 90 seconds and I was happy about it. Why did this had to be disabled? What's so wrong about 90 seconds? - the ""increase/decrease by 1 minute"" buttons are missing. You now have to fiddle with the system keyboard to achieve this. Inconvenient. - icons are used instead of texts. App looks ""cooler"" but it's harder to determine which option does what. Again - inconvenient.  I use Android Marshmallow and the old UI worked perfectly for me. The new UI adds nothing - removes some functionality and makes other functionality harder to use.

1,gp_AOqpTOGXkjyeuhQ8Mq-VYL3Zij_LlvDYQrVSitLBgDdxYEoiQwmwkVEXzahviy7-evstMMjMm-Oci-IHASy4gg-header -included.txt,Trying to find a cross platform note taking app to replace Google Keep and Evernote. This looked promising... until I really used it. The real problem is the text editing window. Its more or less unusable on a 720p phone screen. Only about 3 lines of text - about 1/6th of the screen - are visible while editing. When trying to do tasks such as selecting text that is more than said 3 lines the screen scrolls nearly out of control. This limited view is entirely due to interface choices made by the developer rather than my screen size. There are all kinds of additional input boxes - tag - fields - and headers visable when simply trying to edit text. It feels like the developer never actually tried to take a note in their own app. On top of that the app uses a markdown style formatting so you can only see the formatting when you preview the note or are not editing it. I don't view notes unless I'm editing them so markdown formatting is useless. Actually - less than useless because markdown formatting makes things HARDER to read.

I would really like to see someone work on a native app to replace it. It's not so unresponsive as to be impractical - but just slow enough to be occasionally annoying (on a Nexus 5).  One specific beef I have is with the emoji. The interface for inserting emoji is the same type-colon-to-see-context-menu approach - which is extremely unwieldy on a smartphone where depending on the input method used - the colon is a lower priority character and is often buried several clicks away. Emoji on smartphones need to be much more accessible. The whole point of emoji is to alleviate text entry through the cumbersome smartphone interface - not exacerbate it. So whoever implements a native Mattermost app - I hope they just copy the standard one-click emoji menu used by every other chat client on the planet  -)  This is true for all Mattermost clients though. The system still pretty much requires you to know the text name of an emoji to find it - which is a weakness with the program. Certainly not game breaking - but an annoyance.,Accessibility Review,works well enough opinion team messaging others note simply wrapper web interface thus really reference implementation would really like see someone work native app replace unresponsive impractical slow enough occasionally annoying nexus one specific beef emoji interface inserting emoji type colon see context menu approach extremely unwieldy smartphone depending input method used colon lower priority character often buried several clicks away emoji smartphones need much accessible whole point emoji alleviate text entry cumbersome smartphone interface exacerbate whoever implements native mattermost app hope copy standard one click emoji menu used every chat client planet true mattermost clients though system still pretty much requires know text name emoji find weakness program certainly game breaking annoyance,Positive

GNU/Linux CLI in the palm of your hand --with the apt package-manager to boot! (It's a custom repo - but it has a pretty good selection - nonetheless. (The only thing I'm really missing is PDFGREP - and I bet there's a simple way to get it that I am overlooking.))   UPDATE: WARNING: DON'T TRY THIS! DISCLAIMER: I KNOW NOTHING!  I *was* overlooking something. I ended up using wget to download the source files for pdfgrep - uncompressed the tarball - cd'd into the newly created directory - ran: [grep /bin/sh *] - changed all instances of ""/bin/sh"" to ""/data/data/com.termux/files/bin/sh"" -then ran [./configure] and then [make]. I didn't ""make install"" - I just cp'd pdfgrep to /data/data/com.termux/files/bin/  THEN cp'd the pdfgrep.1 file in the /doc directory (which was inside my pdfgrep directory (which was created during this build)) into the man1 dir via: [cp doc/pdfgrep.1 /data/data/com.termux/files/man/man1/] Now I can execute pdfgrep - and I can enter ""man pdfgrep"" and it all works (and searches the contents of the PDF files on my sd card). Then I removed the tarball and the build directory.  Oh - and my phone is NOT ROOTED - by the way - and that hasn't kept from me from doing anything yet.  You can get Termux-API to add a few more features - like the ability to send and read SMS messages from the command line. You can also import your contacts - and more neat stuff.  You get access to your SD card (after enter a short command one time).  I was using (or attempting to use) one of the other most popular terminal emulators - but it was less than bare-bones - with no package manager... Needless to say - I was thrilled to discover this one.  The controls are easy to adapt to within a day or two. (Volume up or down gives you your CTRL and/or ALT action.)  I love running my scripts on my phone - and you just use [ termux-fix-shebang  ] to make it executable in the app. (The directory path in Termux is a little longer than just /bin/bash - it's /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin.)  I've even got $(apt list) and $(apt show) piping into dialog then into $(apt install) for a quasi-GUI type package manager setup deal. (It's dirty - but it gives me a selection box with descriptions.)  Anyways - I could ramble on and on...  I tried quite a few other options to have GNU/Linux in my Samsung Galaxy 6 - but nothing compares to this.  So - get this app if you love BASH!

This is a solid effort that's really well put together for something that's free and open source!  There's more information that you can shake a stick at - and plenty of customization (although it can always use more - like adjustable delays between animated frames - and things like that.)    The only issues I have with it are the national radar map graphic is squished and can't be zoomed - so it's almost impossible to select radars from that particular image. (Radars can be selected by long-pressing on the actual radar window itself - though which is even more handy!)  The other issue is that city/town names on the edge of the display tend to get all bunched up and unreadable.  Animation is slow or doesn't render correctly on L2 data - but I see the author has offered a possible solution to that - so I'll update this if it fixes my problem there.    So - that's it.  A few tiny little issues but not enough to deduct any stars.  The more I use it - and more I learn - the more I am impressed with the effort put into this app.,Accessibility Review,like lot reviewers stumbled across pykl development ended app stopped working solid effort really well put together something free open source information shake stick plenty customization although always use like adjustable delays animated frames things like issues national radar map graphic squished zoomed almost impossible select radars particular image radars selected long pressing actual radar window though even handy issue city town names edge display tend get bunched unreadable animation slow render correctly data see author offered possible solution update fixes problem tiny little issues enough deduct stars use learn impressed effort put app,Positive

The foremost issue is that oftentimes some information won't get saved - such as the character's names - or its two top aspects - for example.   That aside - other features to focus on moving forward are of course the ability to sync this app with other devices - since this is at its heart an informational reference app. Another important emphasis looks like it will be in expanding data types. What this refers to is things like adding descriptions to each aspect to elaborate upon - usually done to suggest a few ideas for invokes and compels. Stunts might want to be set up in a similar fashion - such that their names can collapse what could often be elaborate descriptions as to what they do. Stress uses up a lot more vertical space than it really needs to - and it would probably be for the best to enable the user to create new stress tracks for more modded games.   Minor details probably include things like being able to label consequence slots with letters to differentiate the specialized physical or mental stress consequences one gains at +5 in the respective skill. Another useful idea might be to create groups underneath a header. For example - on the main Fate Sheets screen - a user may want to organize their characters by genre - or by PCs versus mooks. Users might also find use in organizing aspects or stunts in this manner. It couldn't hurt to future-proof - and it's possible to accomplish these things without cluttering up the screen too much.,Accessibility Review,handy thing like kind needs polishing really charging cents foremost issue oftentimes information get saved character names two top aspects example aside features focus moving forward course ability sync app devices since heart informational reference app another important emphasis looks like expanding data types refers things like adding descriptions aspect elaborate upon usually done suggest ideas invokes compels stunts might want set similar fashion names collapse could often elaborate descriptions stress uses lot vertical space really needs would probably best enable user create new stress tracks modded games minor details probably include things like able label consequence slots letters differentiate specialized physical mental stress consequences one gains respective skill another useful idea might create groups underneath header example main fate sheets screen user may want organize characters genre pcs versus mooks users might also find use organizing aspects stunts manner hurt future proof possible accomplish things without cluttering screen much,Positive

I also think comment indentation could be a little bigger to emphasize you're going to a deeper level.  On the subreddit view - there should be a maximum size for the thumbnail when the big picture mode is on - so large images don't take up as much screen space. The cards could also be a little tweaked to become more organized - and reduce the overcrowding of information around the title of the post. It would be nice if there was some form of indication so we could know - beforehand - what type of link are we clicking on when big picture mode is NOT activated â€” is it an image? Gif? Video?  Lastly - search should be more accessible (it could replace the multi-column icon on the action bar) - because it's something people do a lot. Also - it should be possible to change the search terms or the subreddit one is searching in without having to go back to the homepage and tap Search again.
